The [Drive-By Truckers](http://www.drivebytruckers.com) is a political band from Athens, Georgia. I am always their fan but finally got a chance to see their concert. The gig was on April 5th, 2018, featuring the songs from their most recent albums, ["American Band"](https://www.npr.org/2016/09/22/494571497/first-listen-drive-by-truckers-american-band) and ["English Oceans"](https://www.npr.org/2014/03/06/286886174/album-review-english-oceans-by-drive-by-truckers). 

What can I say about the show? Put simply, it was awesome! Songs after songs, this band is just so skilled at conveying human details yet keeping their music powerful as ever. In my opinion, this is one of the rarer traits in today's music scenes. So when NPR review says they might be the best band in the country (U.S.), I tend to agree.
